Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the process of applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. in the technology industry, software engineering has aided develop solutions to day to day lives. tgis includes enabling creation of software apps and systems powering various aspects of life like health, communication. commerce among others. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. development of programming languages- languages made it possible for humans to write codes amd instructions for computer using words and other signs and not numbers as ot was before.
2. establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960- this made ot possible for it to have processes and a structure which includes designing, building, testing and maintenance of software.
3. rise of agile methodologies - such methodologies introduced a more flexible and iterative methods to software engineering. software development became more adaptable and flexible unlike long term and rigid methods of the past 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirements - here you gather the user needs, the problem at hand and the requirements of the system.
2. design - here one creates high level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
agile is flexible and iterative process that has continuous feedback and adaptations. best for systems that need continuous updating to align with end users needs like in e-commerce website and even gaming apps. 
waterfall the process is step by step. one must finish one step before going to the next. it is best for project with fixed requirements like development of software for car automation or one for space crafts. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - they write codes and implement software solutions 
quality assurance engineer - designs and executes test plans which ensure the quality of the software 
project manager - they are incharge of overseeing planning, execution and delivery of software projects 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites which provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes. they include visual studio and eclipse 
VCS are software tools used for tracking changes to the source codes and coordinating work among team members eg git subversion 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. changing requirements - requirements at times change during development cycles and as such leading to project delays and increased scope.
2. tight deadlines - pressure to finish might lead to rudhed development with a compromised quality.
3. technical debt- can be a hindrance to future development of the software and high maintenance costs. occurs when one uses shortcuts or suboptimal solutions.
solutions include agile methodologies, effective communications, task prioritization, regular reassessment of project goals and timelines. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit- used for testing individual components or modules in a software 
integration - used for testing interactions between different components of the system 
system - used to test the whole software system as a whole 
acceptance - used to test the software against user requirements thus ensuring it meets their needs 
the testing ate important because it aids with continuous integration thus help identify and fix errors early in the development phases thus high quality software products. 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering revolve around crafting questions and statements strategically in order to get the required specific outcome from an AI model. it's important as it helps make specific and clear  commands or questions so that AI understands what one needs 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague - how many medals dod Kenya
specific - how many medals did Kenya win in the just concluded Olympics of 2024? please indicate them in terms of gold, silver amd bronze. 
the second one is more effective as it indicates the exact event, the year, and the number of medals in terms of bronze silver and gold thus one gets the specific information they want.
